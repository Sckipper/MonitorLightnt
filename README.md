# Monitor Lightn't
Windows Forms app to control monitor brightness, contrast + a shadowing layer.

This project is a combination of DimWin-Brightness (https://github.com/reblGreen/DimWin-Brightness) and Win10_BrightnessSlider (https://github.com/blackholeearth/Win10_BrightnessSlider) + aditional work.
